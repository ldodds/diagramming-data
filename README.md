# A visual language for describing data flows

Repository to capture outputs and host additional discussion around the creation of a visual vocabulary for describing data flows.

* The [original concept sketches](https://twitter.com/ldodds/status/905497575700226049) are online. See twitter thread for discussion and comments.
* **[Current version of the vocabulary](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10kRgCDIckP2rkCVP-1bbv0QlqhjiJb3MnVyvA-T8jUI/edit?usp=sharing)**

## How to contribute

Please post an issue with here as I think it will be easier to track individual comments and feedback. At the moment I'm using Google Slides to organise the documentation but it doesn't offer a great way to host discussions (can't easily comment on individual items or suggest new slides).

* [Data Flow Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_diagram) are an existing notation, which covers functions, inputs, outputs, and flows. The notation in this project doesn't describe inputs/outputs, only flows between datasets. DFD notation also doesn't use shape or size as a means to convey information about a function, or define any basic primitives.
