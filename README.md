# A visual language for describing data flows

Repository to capture outputs and host additional discussion around [this prototype visual vocabulary for describing data flows](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10kRgCDIckP2rkCVP-1bbv0QlqhjiJb3MnVyvA-T8jUI/edit?usp=sharing).

The [original concept sketches](https://twitter.com/ldodds/status/905497575700226049) are online. See twitter thread for discussion and comments.

[Current version of the vocabulary](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10kRgCDIckP2rkCVP-1bbv0QlqhjiJb3MnVyvA-T8jUI/edit?usp=sharing).

How to contribute: please post an issue with here as I think it will be easier to track individual comments and feedback. At the moment I'm using Google Slides to organise the documentation but it doesn't offer a great way to host discussions (can't easily comment on individual items or suggest new slides).
